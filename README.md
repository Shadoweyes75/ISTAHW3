This is a mock repository for ISTA 429

The purpose of this project is to gather, enter, and analyze data regarding any differing/alternative effects (adverse or not) from vaping when compared to traditional nicotine cigarettes. Must be able to manipulate data and work well with other team members to get the data analyzed and stored, which will then be used for further research and academic papers.

All raw .csv files will be found in the data folder.

Make sure that results from the scraper are saved under results.

Make sure to read the requirements to know what the state of the code is.
